## Analyzing green-up phenology of North American forest ecosystems with PhenoCam and AmeriFlux data
This paper tests the hypothesis that the date at which the annual air temperature crosses the annual soil temperature of certain forest ecosystems can be used as a proxy for the date at which green-up occurs in these enviroments.

#### Running Code
To run code, ensure that the python file containing all code for this analysis is under the same directory as the files in Site Data. (Placing the python file in the Site Data directory will allow code to run smoothly.)

#### Statistical Packages
User will need statistical packages pandas, numpy, scipy, mathplotlib, and seaborn to run the python file. See lines 8 - 19 of the python file for more information.
