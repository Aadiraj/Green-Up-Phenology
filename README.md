## Analyzing green-up phenology of North American forest ecosystems with PhenoCam and AmeriFlux data
This paper tests the hypothesis that the date at which the annual air temperature crosses the annual soil temperature of certain forest ecosystems can be used as a proxy for the date at which green-up occurs in these enviroments.

### Running Code
To run code smoothly, place all AMF csv files into a folder named AMF_SITE_DATA. Then ensure that files/folders AMF_Mean_Ann_Air_Temp.py, Figures, PhenoCam_V2_1674, and AMF_SITE_DATA are all under the same parent directory.

### Statistical Packages
User will need statistical packages pandas, numpy, scipy, mathplotlib, and seaborn to run the python file. See lines 8 - 19 of the python file for more information.
