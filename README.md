## Analyzing green-up phenology of North American forest ecosystems with PhenoCam and AmeriFlux data
This paper tests the hypothesis that the date at which the annual air temperature crosses the annual soil temperature of certain forest ecosystems can be used as a proxy for the date at which green-up occurs in these enviroments.
