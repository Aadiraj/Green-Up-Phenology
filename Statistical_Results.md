## Estimated Regression Coefficients
The following table summarizes the coefficients for the linear regression of the date the soil temperature crossed the mean anual air temperature against the green-up dates determined for the PhenoCam data for each site. These coefficients statistify the equation 

    ŷ = Xβ + α

The table also includes the standard error of the beta coefficient and the p-value of the regression.


| β | α | Standard Error | P-value |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|0.4601 |70.7219 | 0.1752 | 0.0114


As one can see, the coefficent determined from the regression analysis exhibits low variance. In addition, we observe a p-value below our signficance threshold of 0.05. These two factors suggest there exists a statistically significant correlation between the date the soil temperature crosses the mean anual air temperature and the green-up date of a given site.
